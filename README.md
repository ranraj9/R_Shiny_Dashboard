# R_Shiny_Dashboard

## About
Using RShiny to develop an interactive dashboard that translates Bank's data into actionable insights and provides data-driven decision-making support to Bank Managers.

## Data
I could not upload the data as the data I used to design was strictly confidential and belonged to the company I worked with.
With necssary changes in the code you could use your own data.
